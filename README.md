## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome A Board Nerds!

Hello! My name is Mark Paul Orbe. I am from MapÃºa Malayan Colleges Laguna, where I am majoring in Information Technology with a focus on Network & Cybersecurity.

I love building and breaking things, figuring out how a system works, and playing with it, which often ends up in breaking them LMAOO.

Currently learning Java for the sake of my sanity.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my GitHub profile
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Cybersecurity stuff.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @behindthemark (Bluesky)
- âš¡ Fun fact: The first ever console that I played with was PlayStation 1
