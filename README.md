## Hi there ğŸ‘‹, Welcome A Board Nerds!

** Hello! My name is Mark Paul Orbe. I am from MapÃºa Malayan Colleges Laguna, where I am majoring in Information Technology with a focus on Network & Cybersecurity.

I love building and breaking stuff, finding how a system works, and playing with it, which would end up in breaking lol.

Currently learning Java for the sake of my sanity.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my GitHub profile
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Cybersecurity stuff.
